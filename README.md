# Connou UG (Haftungsbeschr√§nkt) Flutter Counter App

This Flutter project is a simple counter application based on the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture. The counter value can be incremented, and we'll be adding the ability to decrement it. When the counter goes negative, the text color will turn red.
